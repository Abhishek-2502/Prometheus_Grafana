## Introduction

**Prometheus** and **Grafana** are two of the most widely used open-source tools for **monitoring, metrics visualization, and alerting** in cloud-native environments.
Together, they form a powerful stack that helps DevOps engineers, SREs, and developers gain **deep observability** into system performance and reliability.

---

## What is Prometheus?

**Prometheus** is an open-source **systems monitoring and alerting toolkit** originally built at **SoundCloud**. It collects and stores metrics as **time series data**, recording information with a timestamp and optional labels.

Prometheus is designed for **reliability**, **scalability**, and **self-sufficiency**, making it ideal for **Kubernetes, Docker, and microservices architectures**.

---

## Key Features of Prometheus

* **Multi-dimensional data model** using key-value pairs (labels).
* **Powerful query language (PromQL)** for aggregating and analyzing metrics.
* **Pull-based data collection** via HTTP endpoints (`/metrics`).
* **No external dependencies**; standalone operation.
* **Built-in alerting** through the **Alertmanager**.
* **Service discovery** for dynamic environments like Kubernetes and EC2.
* **Time-series database (TSDB)** optimized for metric storage.

---

## Prometheus Architecture

Prometheus follows a **modular and pull-based architecture**:

```
+----------------+         +---------------------+       +----------------+
|   Exporters /   |        |      Prometheus     |       |   Alertmanager |
|  Instrumented   | -----> |        Server       | ----> | (Alerts, Email,|
|  Applications   |        | (Scraping & Storage)|       | Slack, etc.)   |
+----------------+         +---------------------+       +----------------+
                                       |
                                       |
                                       v
                              +-----------------+
                              | Grafana / API   |
                              | (Visualization) |
                              +-----------------+
```

## Core Components of Prometheus

| Component             | Description                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prometheus Server** | The core service that scrapes and stores time-series data.               |
| **Exporters**         | Expose metrics from third-party systems (e.g., Node Exporter, cAdvisor). |
| **Alertmanager**      | Handles alerts sent by Prometheus; routes notifications.                 |
| **Pushgateway**       | Allows ephemeral jobs to push metrics to Prometheus.                     |
| **Service Discovery** | Dynamically identifies targets in Kubernetes, EC2, etc.                  |
| **PromQL Engine**     | Executes queries for visualization and analysis.                         |

---

## Data Model and Metrics Types

Prometheus stores data as **time series**, uniquely identified by:

```
<metric_name>{label1="value1", label2="value2", ...}
```

### Metric Types

| Type          | Description                                                   | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Counter**   | Monotonic value that only increases.                          | HTTP requests served.        |
| **Gauge**     | Value that can go up or down.                                 | Memory usage, temperature.   |
| **Histogram** | Samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets. | Request durations.           |
| **Summary**   | Provides quantiles over a sliding time window.                | Request latency percentiles. |

---

## PromQL â€“ Query Language

**PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)** enables **filtering, aggregating, and analyzing metrics** in real time.

### Example Queries

```promql
# CPU usage per instance
rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[5m])

# HTTP request rate per endpoint
rate(http_requests_total[1m])

# Memory usage of each container
container_memory_usage_bytes{job="kubernetes"}
```

---

## Alerting with Prometheus

Prometheus provides **flexible and rule-based alerting**.

### Alert Flow:

1. Prometheus evaluates **alert rules** based on metrics and thresholds.
2. Alerts are sent to the **Alertmanager**.
3. Alertmanager performs **deduplication, grouping, and routing**.
4. Notifications are sent via **Slack, Email, PagerDuty, Webhooks**, etc.

Example alert rule:

```yaml
groups:
- name: cpu_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[5m]) > 0.8
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High CPU usage detected"
      description: "CPU usage exceeded 80% for 2 minutes."
```

## What is Grafana?

**Grafana** is an open-source **analytics and visualization platform** for monitoring and observability.
It integrates with multiple data sources â€” including Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, and Elasticsearch â€” to create **interactive dashboards and real-time analytics**.

---

## Key Features of Grafana

* Rich **visualization options** (graphs, heatmaps, gauges, tables).
* **Multi-source support** (Prometheus, Loki, MySQL, etc.).
* **Templated dashboards** for dynamic views.
* **Alerting and annotation** support.
* **User authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)**.
* **Dashboard versioning and sharing.**

---

## Grafana Architecture

Grafanaâ€™s modular structure allows seamless integration with any monitoring ecosystem.

```
+----------------------+
|     Data Sources     |
|  (Prometheus, Loki)  |
+----------+-----------+
           |
           v
+----------------------+
|   Grafana Backend    |  <--- Handles APIs, Auth, Alerting
+----------+-----------+
           |
           v
+----------------------+
|     Frontend UI      |  <--- Dashboards & Visualization
+----------------------+
```

## Prometheusâ€“Grafana Integration

Prometheus acts as the **data source**, and Grafana provides the **visualization layer**.

**Workflow:**

1. Prometheus scrapes metrics and stores them as time series.
2. Grafana queries Prometheus using PromQL.
3. Data is rendered into real-time, interactive dashboards.

**Common Dashboards:**

* System performance (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
* Kubernetes cluster metrics.
* API latency and error rates.
* Application uptime and availability.

## Common Use Cases

| Domain               | Use Case                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **DevOps & SRE**     | Infrastructure and application monitoring        |
| **Kubernetes**       | Cluster health, pod resource usage               |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**  | Build and deployment performance                 |
| **Microservices**    | API latency and service dependency visualization |
| **Business Metrics** | Real-time SLA, SLO, and KPI tracking             |

---

## Best Practices

* Use **consistent metric naming conventions** (snake_case).
* Leverage **labels** for dimensional metrics.
* Avoid unbounded label cardinality.
* Configure **retention periods** wisely to balance storage.
* Use **recording rules** for frequently queried expressions.
* Keep Grafana dashboards **modular and parameterized**.
* Secure both tools using **authentication and role-based access**.
* Monitor Prometheus itself using **self-metrics (`prometheus_*`)**.
